# ERL Evidence for Resilient Livestock: The ERA Livestock Data Ecosystem

## Repository Overview
This repository is part of the **Evidence for Resilient Agriculture (ERA)** data ecosystem, focusing on livestock data. It demonstrates ERA’s capacity to integrate and analyze diverse datasets on livestock management practices, feed types, and productivity outcomes. The repository supports research on agricultural resilience, helping identify sustainable practices to enhance productivity, environmental sustainability, and resilience under diverse contexts.

## Background
The **Evidence for Resilient Agriculture (ERA)** initiative is a comprehensive ecosystem of modular projects designed to synthesize evidence supporting sustainable agricultural development. ERA is built on a shared data management system and a controlled vocabulary, facilitating consistent and scalable analysis across diverse geographies and contexts.

This repository is part of **Evidence for Resilient Livestock (ERL)**, a subset of ERA that focuses specifically on livestock management practices. ERL takes a deep dive into the livestock components of ERA, particularly experimental data on animal feeding practices. By leveraging the ERA data model, ERL provides tools and analyses to explore how different feed types and practices impact livestock productivity, resilience, and sustainability. This repository gives users access to ERA's livestock data model and enables detailed analysis of animal feed experiments, offering insights that extend beyond the broader ERA publication.
